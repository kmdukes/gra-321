      We stand swaddled against the <br>
      bitter chill on a tiny ship platform.<br>
      The whipping wind and churning<br>
      seas set the Zodiac bobbing up and down, up <br>
      and down, like a cork in the water. There are <br>
      12 of us strapped in to the boat. Our driver,<br>
      an auburn-haired Aussie marine biologist,<br>
      fearless and cheery, starts the motor. This is<br>
      her 11th Antarctic cruise, but her enthusiasm <br>
      matches that of the first-timers. When a <br>
      humpback sud足denly breaches in a graceful <br>
      arch beside us, we gasp and she whoops with <br>
      joy, weaving the boat between icebergs and <br>
      bringing us shock足ingly close to a leopard seal<br>
      on top of the ice; it's so close we see its<br>
      whiskers twitch as it sleeps. We stand up one<br>
      by one-to keep the boat steady-snapping the<br>
      first of thousands of Antarctic photos.<br>
      Expedition team members await our arrival <br>
      in the frigid water near the peninsula landing<br>
      spot to help us wade to the relative stability<br>
      of the rocky shore. I stop here, astounded by<br>
      the hundreds of penguins on snowy cliffs.<br>
      Their sounds-peeps, moans, and donkey-like<br>
    </div><div class="c2">
      brays-bounce off the mountains. We climb<br>
      the "penguin highway," a path through<br>
      the snow the birds create to waddle and hop along<br>
      between nests and sea. In my parka I'm <br>
      grin足ning like a fool.<br>
      The shores of Antarctica and other near<br>
      足impossible-to-reach places are getting easier to<br>
      access with the rise of the expedition-style<br>
      cruise. It's intimate and exploratory, a way to<br>
      navigate the world that scratches an itch<br>
      similar to the one that led us in our younger<br>
      years to backpack into wild, underexplored<br>
      stretches of the planet. These ships generally<br>
      have only around 200 passengers on board;<br>
      mine includes an intrepid set of established<br>
      world travelers, from urbanites to academics to<br>
      empty nesters with time and savings to burn.<br>
      Travel now largely prioritizes experience over<br>
      material, so it's no surprise that most of the top<br>
      lines are getting in on the action, including<br>
      Silversea, whose compact Silver Cloud is the<br>
      one zipping me within feet of those napping<br>
      seals. It squeezes us through the Antarctic<br>
      tributaries that empty into the cold...</div>

      Hard-to-access natural phenomena like glaciers (opposite, top left), wildlife such as Adelie penguins (previous spread and above), <br>
      and coastlines in off-grid countries like Greenland (opposite, bottom left) are the attractions on expedition-style cruises<br>
